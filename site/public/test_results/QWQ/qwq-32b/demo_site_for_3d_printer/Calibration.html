        <h3>Bed Leveling</h3>
        <p>Bed leveling ensures the print surface is flat and at the correct height relative to the nozzle. Use a piece of paper to test the gap between the nozzle and bed. Adjust the bed screws until the paper is slightly resistant when pulled through.</p>
        <h3>Extruder Calibration</h3>
        <p>Calibrate the extruder steps to ensure accurate filament extrusion. Use a ruler to measure extruded filament length and adjust the steps/mm in the printer's firmware.</p>
        <h3>Temperature Tuning</h3>
        <p>Test extrusion temperatures for different filaments. Start with the manufacturer's recommended temperatures and adjust by ±5°C as needed for better flow or adhesion.</p>

  <h1>Guidance on Changing Filament for Your 3D Printer</h1>

  <p>Changing filament in your printer is an essential task that can be done quickly and efficiently. Here are the steps to follow:</p>

  <h2>Steps Involved:</h2>
  <ol class='list-decimal pl-4'>
    <li><strong>Prepare Your Workspace:</strong> Ensure that your workspace is clean and free from any debris.</li>
    <li><strong>Warm Up the Printer:</strong> Before changing filament, it's important to warm up your printer. This helps in making the process smoother since the hot end will already be at a good temperature for filament extrusion.</li>
    <ul class='list-disc pl-4'>
      <li>If you're switching between different types of filament (e.g., ABS and PLA), it's crucial to clean out the hotend thoroughly. Residues from one type might affect prints with another.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Prepare the New Filament:</strong> Cut a few inches off the end of the new filament spool, then gently pull the filament through your extruder gear until it comes out smoothly and without any jams.</li>
  </ol>

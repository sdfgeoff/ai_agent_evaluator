  <h1>Calibration Guide for Your 3D Printer</h1>
  <p>To ensure that your prints are precise and of high quality, proper calibration is crucial. Calibration involves adjusting the parameters of your printer to align it with its manufacturer specifications.</p>

  <h2>Steps Involved:</h2>
  <ul class='list-disc pl-4'>
    <li><strong>Leveling the Bed:</strong> Ensure that your print bed is perfectly level. This can be done using a calibration tool or simply by adjusting the bed screws until all corners of the bed touch a sheet of paper evenly.</li>
    <ul class='list-disc pl-4'>
      <li>If you're using a print mat, ensure it's well-adhered to the bed before starting your print.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Checking Z-Axis:</strong> Adjust the height of the nozzle until it just barely touches the surface of the paper. This ensures that when printing, the first layer is deposited at the correct height.</li>
    <li><strong>Bed Calibration with Square Test:</strong> Print a square test and measure its dimensions using calipers. This will give you an idea if your printer's calibration is accurate or not.</li>
  </ul>

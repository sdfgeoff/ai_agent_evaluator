<h1>Maintenance of Your 3D Printer</h1>
<p>To ensure the longevity and reliability of your 3D printer, regular maintenance is necessary.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cleaning Internal Components</strong>: Use a compressed air can to gently remove dust and other debris from internal parts. Avoid using liquid or harsh cleaning agents.
</li>
<li><strong>Inspecting for Wear and Tear</strong>: Regularly inspect the printer's components, especially belts, gears, bearings, and nozzles for wear signs.
<p>Note: Replacements may be needed if parts are worn to a critical level.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Lubrication</strong>: Lubricate moving parts such as bearings or gears. Make sure the lubricant you use is compatible with your printer's materials and environment.
<p>Note: Over-lubrication can lead to issues.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Updating Software/Firmware</strong>: Keep your printer's software and firmware up-to-date for security, performance enhancements, and new features.

<p>Note: Always download updates from the official manufacturer site or a trusted source only.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Calibration Checks</strong>: Periodically check that all parts of the printer are properly calibrated. This will ensure consistent and high-quality prints.

    <p>Note: Calibration can be checked by following steps similar to what you find on our main page, in the 'calibration' section.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Post Processing</h1>
<p>After successfully printing your part or object on a 3D printer, there are several steps you can take to improve the final product. This process is called post-processing.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sanding and Filing</strong>: Smooth out any rough edges or surfaces with sandpaper, files, or similar tools.
<p>Note: Be very careful not to remove too much material as this may affect the structural integrity of your print.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Painting or Coating</strong>: Apply a paint or coating that complements or enhances the object. This can protect it from damage and make it more visually appealing.
<p>Note: Choose a suitable finish for the application, considering environmental conditions and use.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Remove any support material left on your print using brushes, solvents, etc.
<p>Note: Ensure to handle cleaning materials safely as some can be toxic or corrosive.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Polishing</strong>: If the object needs a high shine, polish it with suitable polishing compounds.
<p>Note: High-polish finishes may not be practical for functional items and should be used only where appearance is paramount.</p>
</li>
</ol>

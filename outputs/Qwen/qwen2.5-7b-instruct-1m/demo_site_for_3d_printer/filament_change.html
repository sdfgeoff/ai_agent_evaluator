            <p>Changing filament in your 3D printer is a common task that can be done efficiently with the right techniques. Follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare a new spool of filament and ensure it's wound correctly.</li>
                <li>Allow the old filament to cool down from the hot end of your printer.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This can take up to 10 minutes depending on the type of filament.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Disconnect the extruder and replace the filament spool. Heat up the hot end to a temperature slightly higher than your usual printing temperature.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is necessary because you will be starting with a cooler filament.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Feed the new filament through the nozzle until it's stable and flowing properly. This typically takes around 20-30 seconds.
            </ol>

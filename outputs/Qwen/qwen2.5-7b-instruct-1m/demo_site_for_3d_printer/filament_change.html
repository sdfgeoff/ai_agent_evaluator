<h1>Changing Filaments</h1>
<p>When you decide to change the filament in your 3D printer, there are a few steps that need to be followed to ensure smooth and efficient printing.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Prepare Your Work Area</strong>: Ensure your work area is clean and free from debris.</li>
<li><strong>Warm-Up the Printer</strong>: Allow the printer to warm up. This helps in melting any residual filament that might be left over.</li>
<li><strong>Clean the Extruder</strong>: Use a small file or a dedicated cleaning tool to remove old filament residues from the extruder.

    <p><em>Note: Be cautious while handling tools near hot machinery and materials.</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Load New Filament</strong>: Carefully load the new filament into your printer. Ensure that you are using a compatible filament type for best results.</li>
<li><strong>Calibration After Change</strong>: After changing the filament, it's important to recalibrate to check how the new material is performing.
    <p>Note: If the calibrations fail, you may need to continue with the processes on the main page such as <a href='calibration.html'>bed leveling and extruder checking</a> until they succeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <h2>Calibration Guide</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ensure your printer is level and that the bed temperature matches your material specifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Measure and adjust the extruder height to be slightly above the build plate but close enough for proper adhesion of first layers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Process for Changing Filament</h2>
        <p>To change filament, you must first ensure your printer has cooled down sufficiently. Follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the extruder to melt any remaining filament.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove the old spool and insert a new one in its place.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Load the new filament into the printer until it starts coming out of the nozzle.</li>
        </ol>

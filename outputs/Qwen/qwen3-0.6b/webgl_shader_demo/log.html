Okay, let's see. The user wants to set up a WebGL demo and have a basic shader example in their index.html file. They also mentioned installing necessary packages.

First, I need to create an HTML file that includes the WebGL code. So, I should write out the basic WebGL setup using JavaScript and include the GLSL shader. Then, make sure they can run it by opening the file in their browser. Since they might not have internet access, maybe I should mention installing packages like glslify or require-gl to get the shaders.

Wait, but how do I handle that? The user might need help with that. So, the answer should guide them through creating the HTML code and perhaps install those packages. Let me check if there's a function for that. Oh, right, there's a create_file function, but it requires content and file_name parameters. Maybe create a file named something like "index.html" with the WebGL code and include the shaders.

Wait, but the user might not have internet access. So maybe the answer is to provide both the HTML setup and instructions on installing necessary packages. That way, they can run the demo on their own system.
&lt;/think&gt;

To set up a basic WebGL demo and include a shader example in your `index.html`, here's how you can proceed:

1. **Create the HTML File**:  
   Use JavaScript to define your WebGL code (e.g., using `&lt;script&gt;` tags or inline GLSL shaders). Include the necessary packages like `glslify` or `require-gl`. For example:
   ```html
   &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
   &lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;WebGL Demo&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
       &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/glslify@2.0.1/dist/glslify.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
       &lt;script&gt;
           const gl = GLSLify.create({}).getContext();
           // Your WebGL code goes here
       &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:  
   If your browser doesn't include these libraries, you may need to install them via npm or a CDN. For example:
   ```bash
   npm install glslify
   ```

Ensure the output is available in `index.html` and that your environment includes the necessary libraries for WebGL (e.g., support for OpenGL). Let me know if you're running it on a specific browser or platform!</div><div class="block"><strong >assistant:</strong> </div></body></html>

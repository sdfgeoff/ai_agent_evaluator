Let me check the tools provided.\n\nThe create_file function is there, which allows creating a file with content. The parameters needed are file_name and content. The user's request mentions creating an SVG file, so I need to use that function. They specified \"sunset-mountain-svg.html\" as the file name and the content should be the SVG code.\n\nWait, in the previous tool call, the assistant used create_file with those arguments. Then, the response was a confirmation message. Now, the user's latest input is just the tool response indicating the file was created. Since there are no more tasks to perform, I should use task_complete. But the user hasn't provided any further commands. So, the correct action here is to inform them that the file is created and maybe ask if they need anything else. The tools don't require additional actions here, so just a simple confirmation.\n</think>\n\nThe SVG image has been successfully created in the file `sunset-mountain-svg.html`. You can open this file in your browser to view the sunset through the mountains visualization.

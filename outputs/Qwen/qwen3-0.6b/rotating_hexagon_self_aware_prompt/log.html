This gives you time to think and plan, however the user will not interact with you as you are completely autonomous. You are in a containerized environment so can install any software tools you need. The user wants you to create an HTML page containing a rotating hexagon with bouncing balls inside it. First think about the structure of the project, such as major software components, and what files you'll need to make. Plan out what you will do before you do it. Save it to `index.html`. There will be no further instructions or clarification given. Good luck and have fun!</div><div class="block"><strong >Tool Request:</strong> 608631452 - task_complete - {}</div></body></html>

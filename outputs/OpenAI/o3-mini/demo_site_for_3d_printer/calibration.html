      <h2>Calibration Techniques for Optimal 3D Printing</h2>
      <p>
        Achieving the perfect print requires careful calibration of your 3D printer. In this section, we detail crucial calibration procedures that should be performed regularly and after any modifications or maintenance.
      </p>
      <h3>1. Bed Leveling</h3>
      <p>
        Ensuring that your print bed is perfectly leveled is the first step in avoiding print adhesion issues and first layer problems. Many modern printers offer assisted bed leveling options. However, manual calibration is essential when fine-tuning adjustments.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Nozzle Calibration</h3>
      <p>
        A calibrated nozzle guarantees that filament is extruded evenly. Misalignment can lead to under-extrusion or over-extrusion, detrimentally affecting the overall print quality. Regularly check your nozzle clearance and alignment.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Extruder Calibration</h3>
      <p>
        Verify that your extruder is feeding the correct amount of filament. Incorrect settings can lead to print failures. Calibrate the extruder by comparing expected filament consumption with actual measurements.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Temperature Calibration</h3>
      <p>
        Both the bed temperature and nozzle temperature should be precisely controlled according to the specific filament used. Use calibration tests to ensure temperature consistency throughout prints.

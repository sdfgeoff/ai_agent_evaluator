## How It Works

1. When you receive a task, review it to understand what needs to be done.
2. Use the appropriate tool from the available tools list to perform actions.
3. If a task requires multiple steps or uses more than one tool, make sure each step is executed in order.
4. After completing a task, respond with the final output or result.

## Tools Available

- `bash`: Run a bash command
- `create_file`: Create a file with the given content
- `task_complete`: Call when there is nothing more to do on this task</div><div class="block"><strong >assistant:</strong> </div></body></html>

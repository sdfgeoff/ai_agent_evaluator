To do this, I'll provide you with SVG code that you can add to your `index.html` file to create the image of a sunset through the mountains. Here's how it might look:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Sunset Through Mountains</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <svg width=\"800\" height=\"600\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n        <!-- Background sky -->\n        <rect width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" fill=\"#87CEEB\"/>\n        \n        <!-- Sun -->\n        <circle cx=\"650\" cy=\"150\" r=\"50\" fill=\"#FFD700\"/>\n        \n        <!-- Mountains -->\n        <path d=\"M0,600 L200,300 L350,500 L500,250 L750,400 L800,600 Z\" fill=\"#8B4513\"/>\n        <path d=\"M0,600 L150,450 L300,550 L450,400 L800,600 Z\" fill=\"#A0522D\"/>\n        \n        <!-- Sunset glow -->\n        <ellipse cx=\"650\" cy=\"150\" rx=\"250\" ry=\"100\" fill=\"#FF7F50\" opacity=\"0.5\"/>\n    </svg>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis code will create a simple SVG image of a sunset with the sun partially visible behind some mountains on a blue sky background. The colors and shapes are quite basic, so you can modify them to get more detailed or realistic results if needed.\n\nYou can paste this code into your `index.html` file to display the image in your web browser.

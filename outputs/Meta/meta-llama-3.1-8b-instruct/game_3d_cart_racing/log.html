You can then use this file as a starting point for your project.

However, if you want to actually implement the game, you would need to write additional code using one of the standard rendering technologies such as Three.js. 

Here's an example of how you might start implementing the game using Three.js:

```javascript
// Import Three.js library
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Create a new scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Create a new camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

// Create a new renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create a new ground plane
const groundGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(100, 100);
const groundMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x000000 });
const ground = new THREE.Mesh(groundGeometry, groundMaterial);
scene.add(ground);

// Create a new car
const carGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 5, 5);
const carMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const car = new THREE.Mesh(carGeometry, carMaterial);
car.position.set(0, 2.5, 0);
scene.add(car);

// Animate the scene
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
```

This code creates a simple scene with a ground plane and a red cube representing a car. You can then add more features to the game such as user input for movement, collision detection, scoring, etc.

Remember that this is just a starting point and you would need to add many more features to create a fully functional racing game.</div><div class="block"><strong >assistant:</strong> </div></body></html>

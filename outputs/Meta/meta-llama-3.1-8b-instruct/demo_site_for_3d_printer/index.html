<h1>Calibration</h1>
<p>The first step in calibrating your 3D printer is to level the print bed. This involves loosening the screws that hold the print bed in place, then tightening them until the bed is level.</p>

<h1>Changing Filament</h1>
<p>To change filament, follow these steps:</p><ol>
<li>Cut the old filament as close to the extruder as possible.</li>
<li>Melt the old filament by extruding a small amount.</li>
<li>Cut the new filament and insert it into the extruder.</li>
<li>Melt the new filament by extruding a small amount.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Printing</h1>
<p>Once your printer is calibrated and you have changed filament, you can start printing. To do this, follow these steps:</p><ol>
<li>Slice your model using a slicing software such as Cura or Slic3r.</li>
<li>Load the sliced model into your 3D printer's control panel.</li>
<li>Start the print job by clicking the 'Print' button.</li>
